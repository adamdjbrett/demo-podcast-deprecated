## Land Acknowledgement
We begin by acknowledging with respect the Onondaga Nation, Central Fire of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, on whose ancestral lands we now inhabit. Wherever you are located be aware of the Indigenous Peoples on whose lands you reside. We are mindful that the technology that makes this conference possible comes from the mineral extraction by multinational corporations, which decimate and displace Indigenous people and their land all over the world. May the information you glean from this podcast motivate you to uphold Indigenous values, protect Mother Earth, Honor Indian Treaties and hold your government and various institutions accountable who stand in the way.

#### Definition
The Doctrine of Discovery is Discovery is a series of Papal Bulls (decrees with legal status) which further fused European Churches and Crowns together creating a theological and legal
justification for enslavement of Muslims (then called Saracens) and Indigenous peoples around the world starting in West Africa. It also justifies the extraction of natural resources from Mother Earth for the benefit of Popes and Princes. Finally it allowed for the exploitation of Mother Earth, the natural world, and all peoples. These Papal Bulls would fuse together into an effective short hand called the Doctrine of Discovery. in 1823 in the United States Chief Justice Johnson v. M'intosh relies on the Christian theological and legal precedence of the Doctrine of Discovery to justify the theft of Indigenous lands. The Doctrine of Discovery is still being used by settler-colonial courts like the U.S. as recently as 2005 when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made reference to the Doctrine of Discovery in  Sherrill V. Oneida (2005) and then again by Justice Neil Gorsuch in the 2020 McGirt v. Oklahoma decision. James Carroll in _Constantine's Sword_ notes that the effective element of the Doctrine of Discovery was to forge Christianity into a weapon of colonization.

The Doctrine of Discovery is a theological tool of oppression and of Christian Hegemony, destructive capital and endless warfare.

### Repudiations
We have a list of repudiations of the Doctrine of Discovery issued by faith communities. One of the most important is the World Council of Churches repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery. Repuidations are the first step of moving towards rescinding the Doctrine of Discovery and moving towards better relationships
